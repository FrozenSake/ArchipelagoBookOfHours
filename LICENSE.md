This Archipelago Mod is unofficial content which modifies and is based on Book of Hours (and quite literally is designed to be injected into the game like a book mark) by [Weather Factory Ltd](https://www.weatherfactory.biz). You should go check them out and support them. Buy their neat stuff. Spend your money on their cool things. Get excited about being an Occult Librarian like I have.
